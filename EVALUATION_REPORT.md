### Summarization Quality Assessment

**Extractive Methods Comparison:**

| Method | Avg Compression | ROUGE-1 F1 | ROUGE-2 F1 | Readability Score |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| TF-IDF | 0.73          | 0.42        | 0.18        | 3.2              |
| TextRank | 0.71        | 0.45        | 0.21        | 3.5              |

**Key Findings:**
- TextRank consistently produced more coherent summaries with better sentence relationships

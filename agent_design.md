**Parameters**:
- `document_ids`: List of documents to compare
- `comparison_type`: Type of comparison (entities, content, structure)

**Output**: Comparison results with similarities, differences, and insights

## ðŸ§  Agent Reasoning Process

### Phase 1: Query Analysis
The agent begins by analyzing the user's natural language query to:

1. **Extract key intent** - Determine what the user wants to accomplish
2. **Identify relevant concepts** - Extract important keywords and entities
3. **Classify query type** - Categorize as search, summarization, analysis, etc.
4. **Determine scope** - Understand the breadth and depth required

### Phase 2: Strategic Planning
Based on the query analysis, the agent creates a multi-step execution plan:

1. **Tool Selection** - Choose appropriate tools for the task
2. **Sequencing** - Determine optimal order of operations
3. **Parameter Planning** - Identify required inputs and configurations
4. **Dependency Mapping** - Understand how outputs feed into subsequent steps

### Phase 3: Execution
The agent executes the planned steps with adaptive reasoning:

1. **Tool Invocation** - Call tools with appropriate parameters
2. **Result Validation** - Check outputs for quality and completeness
3. **Error Handling** - Manage failures and alternative approaches
4. **Context Propagation** - Pass relevant information between steps

### Phase 4: Synthesis
Finally, the agent combines all gathered information:

1. **Information Integration** - Merge outputs from multiple tools
2. **Insight Generation** - Identify patterns and key findings
3. **Response Formulation** - Create coherent, comprehensive answers
4. **Quality Assessment** - Evaluate response completeness and accuracy

## ðŸ”„ Agent Flow Examples

### Example 1: Customer Support Analysis
**Query**: "Summarize the top issues customers are facing from support tickets over the last 7 days"

**Agent Reasoning**:
1. **Analysis**: User wants recent support ticket summarization with issue identification
2. **Planning**: 
   - Search for recent support tickets (7 days)
   - Extract entities to identify issue types
   - Summarize ticket content for key problems
   - Analyze trends in issue frequency

**Execution Flow**:
```
search_documents(query="support ticket", filters={"date_range": "7_days"})
    â†“
extract_entities(document_ids=[...], entity_types=["PROBLEM", "PRODUCT"])
    â†“
summarize_document(document_ids=[...], method="tfidf")
    â†“
analyze_trends(entity_type="PROBLEM", time_range="7_days")
    â†“
Synthesize comprehensive support issue report
```

### Example 2: Research Document Comparison
**Query**: "Compare AI research papers from Google and Microsoft this year"

**Agent Reasoning**:
1. **Analysis**: User wants comparative analysis of research papers by organization
2. **Planning**:
   - Search for AI papers from each organization
   - Extract key entities and topics
   - Summarize major findings
